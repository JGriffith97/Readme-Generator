## Description

This is a README generator made for the express purpose of creating READMEs for future projects (and this one!). As part of the Module 9 Challenge of the UofU's Coding Bootcamp.

---
## Installation

This application runs via NodeJS purely in the command line; please refer to NodeJS docs for installation: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

---
## Usage

Assuming NodeJS is installed, from the command line type 'npm init' to initialize the node package manager in the 'main' directory. Then type 'npm i' which will install the relevant dependencies. Then, simply type 'node index' in the command line to initialize the application. **NOTE: Ensure that your Terminal is within the 'main' directory to properly initialize the application!**
